  <h2>Nucleophilic Substitution</h2>
  <p>
    A nucleophile is something that is attracted to positive charges. Examples include F<sup>-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. Nucleophilic substitution occurs when a nucleophile is
    placed in a relatively cold environment with organic molecules that have a nucleophile, where the molarity is relatively low. Stronger nucleophiles can replace weaker
    nucleophiles. There are two types of nucleophilic substitution, S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2.
  </p>
  <h3>S<sub>N</sub>2</h3>
  <p>
    In these reactions, there is one step. The nucleophile donates an electron pair to the carbon on the organic molecule that is attached to the weaker nucleophile
    while the electrons from the carbon's bond with the weaker nucleophile go to the weaker nucleophile. This forms a transition state where both nucleophiles have half-bonds
    with the same carbon. Then, the weaker nucleophile breaks away and the stronger nucleophile forms a full bond with the carbon. This type of bond is more likely to occur 
    when there is less steric hinderance, which is explained in the next section. It is slower than S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions.
  </p>
   <h3>S<sub>N</sub>1</h3>
  <p>
    In these reactions, there are two steps. In the first step, the weaker nucleophile, which is attached to a carbon, takes the electrons from its bond with the 
    carbon and breaks away completely. In the second step, the stronger nucleophile forms a bond with the same carbon by donating two electrons. The state of the 
    organic molecule inbetween these two steps, where the carbon is not bonded to either nucleophile and has a positive charge is called the carbocation. This reaction is
    more likely to occur where there is more steric hinderance. Steric hinderance is based on what the reacting carbon is surrounded by. If it is surrounded by more carbons,
     it will have more steric hinderance, while if it is surrounded by hydrogens it has less steric hinderance. This is important because where there is more steric hinderance,
    the partial negative charges of the surrounding carbons help stabilize the carbocation.
  </p>
  <h2>Radical Substitution</h2>
  <p>
    A radical is a molecule or atom with an unpaired electron. These can be created by ultraviolet light hitting a molecule, like diatomic chlorine, and splitting it,
    into chlorine radicals, for example, which would have seven valence electrons. This step is called initiation. Then, the radical can go and 'attack' other non-radical
     molecules, bonding with part of the molecule and making the other part into a radical, which can then go attack other non-radical molecule, continuing the cycle. This
     step is called propagation. The final step, termination, occurs when two radicals bond to each other, so that the product is not a radical and cannot create more radicals.
  </p>
  <h2>Electrophilic Addition</h2>
  <p>
    An electrophile is something that is attracted to a negative charge. For this type of reaction, it is commonly hydrogen. In electrophic addition reactions, a
     nucleophile bonded to an electrophile comes into contact with an organic molecule that includes a double bond. The organic molecule donates two electrons from the
    double bond, making it a single bond, to the electrophile, which causes it to bond to one of the carbons that previously had the double bond. The electrons from
     the bond between the nucleophile and electrophile go to the nucleophile. Then, the nucleophile donates a pair of electrons to the other carbon that previously had
     a double bond, bonding with it. By this process, two molecules react to form one molecule.
  </p>
  <h2>Radical Addition Polymerization</h2>
  <p>
    This starts with initiation, where a radical is formed using ultraviolet light, like in radical substitution. Then, the radical attacks a variation of ethene, which
     has two carbons and a double bond between them. One of the electrons from the double bond joins with the unpaired electron from the radical to bond the radical to the 
    organic molecule and the other electron goes to the other side of the organic molecule to make it a radical. This new radical then goes and attacks other organic molecules,
     adding them to the chain. The chains can become very long, reaching thousands or even millions of carbons. The process ends with termination, as described under radical
     substitution. The ethene variant is called the monomer so that a polymer is made up of many monomers.
