  <h2>Nucleophilic Substitution</h2>
  <p>
    A nucleophile is something that is attracted to positive charges. Examples include F<sup>-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. Nucleophilic substitution occurs when a nucleophile is
    placed in a relatively cold environment with organic molecules that have a nucleophile, where the molarity is relatively low. Stronger nucleophiles can replace weaker
    nucleophiles. There are two types of nucleophilic substitution, S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2.

  <h3>S<sub>N</sub>2</h3>
  <p>
    In these reactions, there is one step. The nucleophile donates an electron pair to the carbon on the organic molecule that is attached to the weaker nucleophile
    while the electrons from the carbon's bond with the weaker nucleophile go to the weaker nucleophile. This forms a transition state where both nucleophiles have half-bonds
    with the same carbon. Then, the weaker nucleophile breaks away and the stronger nucleophile forms a full bond with the carbon. This type of bond is more likely to occur 
    when there is less steric hinderance, which is explained in the next section. It is slower than S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions.

   <h3>S<sub>N</sub>1</h3>
  <p>
    In these reactions, there are two steps. In the first step, the weaker nucleophile, which is attached to a carbon, takes the electrons from its bond with the 
    carbon and breaks away completely. In the second step, the stronger nucleophile forms a bond with the same carbon by donating two electrons. The state of the 
    organic molecule inbetween these two steps, where the carbon is not bonded to either nucleophile and has a positive charge is called the carbocation. This reaction is
    more likely to occur where there is more steric hinderance. Steric hinderance is based on what the reacting carbon is surrounded by. If it is surrounded by more carbons,
     it will have more steric hinderance, while if it is surrounded by hydrogens it has less steric hinderance. This is important because where there is more steric hinderance,
    the partial negative charges of the surrounding carbons help stabilize the carbocation.
