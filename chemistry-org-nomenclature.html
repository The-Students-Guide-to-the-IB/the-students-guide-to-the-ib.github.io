    Alkanes are the most basic of organic chemicals. They include only carbons and hydrogens, where the carbons are all bonded together in a line and the hydrogens are bonded to them.
    Their names are dependent on how many carbons are in the chain. Here are the first nine with diagrams:<br>Methane: CH<sub>4</sub><br>Ethane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Propane:
    CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Butane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Pentane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
    <br>Hexane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Heptane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
    <br>Octane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Nonane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>
    -CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br><br>
    Alkenes are slightly more advanced than alkanes. The functional group of an alkene is a Carbon-Carbon double bond(C=C). Names for alkenes are the same as for alkanes, but
     have -ene in place of -ane. If the molecule can have a double bond in multiple places, a number is required before the -ene to show where the bond is. The number should
    be the number of the carbon that the bond is on closest to the outside. Here are two examples:<br>Ethene: CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> Here there is no number required 
    because the C=C bond can only be on the outer carbons.<br>But-2-ene: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH=CH-CH<sub>3</sub> A number is required here because the C=C bond could either
     be between the first and second carbons or the second and third carbons. Since the bond is between carbons 2 and 3 and 2 is less than 3, we use 2 in the name. This
     principle of numbering is used for other organic molecules, so it would be helpful to remember it.<br><br>
    Alkynes are the same as Alkenes but with a Carbon-Carbon triple(C≡C) bond instead of double. They use the -yne ending. Here are some examples:<br>
    Ethyne: CH≡CH<br>But-2-yne: CH<sub>3</sub>-C≡C-CH<sub>3</sub><br><br>
    Alcohols are different from the other organic molecules discussed so far. Instead of having a different carbon-carbon bond, they have a functional group. This group is
    OH, an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen. The numbering, like before, is based on the carbon the functional group is attached to. The ending, -ol, replaces the 'e' at the
    end of the alkane names. Here are some examples:<br>Ethanol: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH<br>Butan-2-ol: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH(OH)-CH<sub>3</sub><br><br>
    Halogenoalkanes are alkanes with a halogen attached. It is based on the number of carbons with a prefix based on the attached halogen. Here are some examples:<br>
    Chloroethane: CClH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>2-bromopropane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CClH-CH<sub>3</sub><br><br>
    Aldehydes always have a carbon-oxygen double bond(C=O) at one of their ends. No number is required for naming because the C=O bond is always at the end. The ending is
     -al and replaces the 'e' at the end. Here are some examples:<br>Ethanal: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH=OH<br>Butanal: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH=O<br><br>
    Ketones are like aldehydes, but their C=O bond is not on one of the end carbons. This means numbering is required in most cases. The ending is -one, which replaces the
    'e'. Here are some examples:<br>Propanone: CH<sub>3</sub>-CO-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Butan-2-one: CH<sub>3</sub>-CO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br><br>
    Carboxylic Acids are when one of the end carbons is bonded to both an OH group and double bonded to an oxygen. Numbering is not required since it is always an end 
    carbon. The ending is -oic acid, which replaces the 'e'. Here are some examples:<br> Ethanoic acid: CH<sub>3</sub>-COOH<br>Butanoic acid: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>
    -CH<sub>2</sub>-COOH<br><br>
    Ethers are organic molecules that include a carbon bonded to an oxygen that is bonded to another carbon(C-O-C). For the side with the lower number of carbons, the
     name is taken, but -oxy replaces the -ane for the first part of the name. The second part is the name of the side with more carbons. The two parts should be combined
    into one word. Here are some examples:<br>Methoxypropane: CH<sub>3</sub>-O-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Ethoxybutane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-O-CH
    <sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br><br>
    Esters are organic molecules where one of the carbons is double bonded to an oxygen and single bonded to an oxygen which is single bonded to another carbon(COO-).
     The first part of the name comes from the carbon chain that starts with a single bond to an oxygen and -yl replaces -ane. The second part of the name comes from
     carbon chain starting with the carbon double bonded to an oxygen and replaces the 'e' with -oate. Here are some examples:<br>Methyl Ethanoate: CH<sub>3</sub>
    -O-CO-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Propyl Methanoate: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-O-CHO<br><br>
    Amines are organic molecules that include nitrogen. Their name is based on the number of carbons with -amine replacing 'e'. If another chain starts from the nitrogen
    , N can be used in place of a number. Here are some examples:<br>Methanamine: CH<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub><br>N-methylethanamine: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-NH
    -CH<sub>3</sub><br><br>
    Amides are organic molecules where one of the carbons is both single bonded to a nitrogen and double bonded to a oxygen. The name is based on the number of carbons but
    -amide replaces 'e'. Here are some examples:<br>Methanamide: CHO-NH<sub>2</sub><br>Propanamide: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CO-NH<sub>2</sub>
