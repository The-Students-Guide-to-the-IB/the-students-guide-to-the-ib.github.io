    Alkanes are the most basic of organic chemicals. They include only carbons and hydrogens, where the carbons are all bonded together in a line and the hydrogens are bonded to them.
    Their names are dependent on how many carbons are in the chain. Here are the first nine with diagrams:<br>Methane: CH<sub>4</sub><br>Ethane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Propane:
    CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Butane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Pentane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
    <br>Hexane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Heptane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
    <br>Octane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Nonane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>
    -CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>
    Alkenes are slightly more advanced than alkanes. The functional group of an alkene is a Carbon-Carbon double bond(C=C). Names for alkenes are the same as for alkanes, but
     have -ene in place of -ane. If the molecule can have a double bond in multiple places, a number is required before the -ene to show where the bond is. The number should
    be the number of the carbon that the bond is on closest to the outsid. Here are two examples:<br>Ethene: CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> Here there is no number required 
    because the C=C bond can only be on the outer carbons.<br>Meth-2-ene: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH=CH-CH<sub>3</sub> A number is required here because the C=C bond could either
     ber between the first and second carbons or the second and third carbons. Since the bond is between carbons 2 and 3 and 2 is less than 3, we use 2 in the name.
