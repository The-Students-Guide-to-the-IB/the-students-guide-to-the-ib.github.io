    Alkanes are the most basic of organic chemicals. They include only carbons and hydrogens, where the carbons are all bonded together in a line and the hydrogens are bonded to them.
    Their names are dependent on how many carbons are in the chain. Here are the first nine with diagrams:<br>Methane: CH<sub>4</sub><br>Ethane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Propane:
    CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Butane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Pentane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
    <br>Hexane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Heptane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
    <br>Octane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>Nonane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>
    -CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br>
    Alkenes are slightly more advanced than alkanes. The functional group of an alkene is a Carbon-Carbon double bond(C=C). Names for alkenes are the same as for alkanes, but
     have -ene in place of -ane. If the molecule can have a double bond in multiple places, a number is required before the -ene to show where the bond is. The number should
    be the number of the carbon that the bond is on closest to the outside. Here are two examples:<br>Ethene: CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> Here there is no number required 
    because the C=C bond can only be on the outer carbons.<br>Meth-2-ene: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH=CH-CH<sub>3</sub> A number is required here because the C=C bond could either
     be between the first and second carbons or the second and third carbons. Since the bond is between carbons 2 and 3 and 2 is less than 3, we use 2 in the name. This
     principle of numbering is used for other organic molecules, so it would be helpful to remember it.<br>
    Alkynes are the same as Alkenes but with a Carbon-Carbon triple(C≡C) bond instead of double. They use the -yne ending. Here are some examples:<br>
    Ethyne: CH≡CH<br>Meth-2-yne: CH<sub>3</sub>-C≡C-CH<sub>3</sub><br>
    Alcohols are different from the other organic molecules discussed so far. Instead of havind a different carbon-carbon bond, they have a functional group. This group is
    OH, an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen. The numbering, like before, is based on the carbon the functional group is attached to. The ending, -ol, replaces the 'e' at the
    end of the alkane names. Here are some examples:<br>Ethanol: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH<br>Methan-2-ol: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH(OH)-CH<sub>3</sub><br>
    Aldehydes always have a carbon-oxygen double bond(C=O) at one of their ends. No number is required for naming because the C=O bond is always at the end. The ending is
     -al and replaces the 'e' at the end. Here are some examples:<br>Ethanal: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH=OH<br>Methanal: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH=O<br>
